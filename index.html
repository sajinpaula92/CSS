    <!--There are three ways to set up CSS to a HTML File. 
         No. 1 is through External CSS(which is linking an external css file to the HTML file.) 
         No. 2 is through Internal CSS(which is setting up css internally in a html file using style element.)
         No. 3 is through Inline CSS(which is writng css code for the lines we need in a HTML file) -->
